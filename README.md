# Sales-Analysis
## Data exploration to analyze business problems, we will look into a 12 months worth of sale data and give insights by answering the following questions:

- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
